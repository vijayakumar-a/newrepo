`awesome-docker` is a hand-crafted list for high-quality information about docker and its resources. I don't feel it should be constraint to docker only ressources, so feel free to add other resources about container or deployement in general. It would be nice if it is related or compatible with docker in some way. But if it's awesome, OK!

- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project or website
- Descriptions should be clear and concise (read it out loud to be sure)
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
- if you want to add more than one link, please don't do all PR on the exact same line, it usually results in conflicts and your PR cannot be automatically merged...

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To be on the list, it would be *nice* if entries adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Clearly stating when a entry is relating to (Linux) containers and not Docker
- Clearly "what is it" --> which category it belongs : article, docker image, dev tools, video, twitter account, ...
- Clearly stating "what is it for": mention the problem it solves. Just try your best, make it clear for the next person.
- Solves a real problem (even a small one)
- if it is a **WIP** (work in progress, not safe for production), mention it. (Remember the time before Docker 1.0 ? ;-) )
